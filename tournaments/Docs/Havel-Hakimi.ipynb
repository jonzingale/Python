    "The Havelâ€“Hakimi algorithm is an algorithm in graph theory solving the graph realization problem. That is, it answers the following question: Given a finite list of nonnegative integers, is there a simple graph such that its degree sequence is exactly this list. Here, the \"degree sequence\" is a list of numbers that for each vertex of the graph states how many neighbors it has. For a positive answer the list of integers is called graphic. The algorithm constructs a special solution if one exists or proves that one cannot find a positive answer. This construction is based on a recursive algorithm. The algorithm was published by Havel (1955), and later by Hakimi (1962).\n"
